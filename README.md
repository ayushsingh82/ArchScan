- **External Transaction Tracking**: Track external transactions involving arch domain addresses.
- **Comprehensive Portfolio Overview**:  ArchScan provides a comprehensive overview of your arch domain portfolio, including detailed information such as time, hash, and more.
- **Future Development**: The future goal of  ArchScan is to evolve into a complete portfolio tracker for Arch. This will include additional features such as portfolio performance analysis, asset allocation insights, and customizable reporting.
